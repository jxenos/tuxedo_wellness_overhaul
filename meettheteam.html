                    <small>Owner/Yoga Instructor</small>
                </h3>
                <p>In my classes, you will be asked to challenge yourself mentally.
					I will encourage you to experience vulnerability and diversities
					of thought in your poses.  Growing confidence in your physical
					practice will help you become stronger when off the mat and when
					faced with challenges, conflicts, and tragedies.  In other words,
					life!  Our worlds turn upside down and inside out from time to
					time.  When you come to yoga, you come for yourself.  You come
					to find peace of mind or to perhaps find an escape.  Or maybe
					you need to open your spine or just feel movement in your body.
					We all come to the yoga mat for a different reason.  We are all
					on a search to find our true greatness.  The best part of living
					 is finding out who we are.  With all my classes, I hope you will
					  find your niche, your energy, your true being.
				</p>
				<p>Our studio, Tuxedo Wellness believes in active community involvement.
					  During different times of the year, you can find me at the Tuxedo
					  Chamber of Commerce, Tuxedo Farmersâ€™ Market, Tuxedo Park School,
					  Town Hall or just supporting local events.  Basically, anywhere
					  I can roll out my mat!
				</p>

				<p>	From the time I was a little girl, I always dreamed big.  I always
					wanted and dreamed of success.  I wrote an article in the fifth
					grade hoping I could become the next famous woman lawyer.  I
					became a yoga instructor instead.
					In my twenties, I always felt unfulfilled.  I really could
					not find my niche.  I went from job to job in retail while
					attending college.  Upon graduation, just in time for the
					crash of 2008, there were no jobs for fresh young Public
					Relations majors.  In the meantime, I continued to study
					yoga and completed my first teacher training in 2011.  I a
					lso explored avenues of bodywork, yoga therapy, and meditation.
					Finally, in 2012 I began my first business.
				</p>

				<p> My current certifications are 200RYT, Yoga Therapy,
					Thai Yoga Bodywork and Ayurveda Abhyanga/Warm Oil.
					I previously studied with Seane Corn and Cameron Shayne.
					Presently I study with Ben Wisch of mPower Yoga. </p>

                    <small>Yoga Instructor</small>
                </h3>
                <p>Shelly became a yoga instructor so she could help others empower themselves. After practicing
                yoga for over 10 years she realized how wonderful yoga is and wanted to share it with
                others. Her goal is to teach others how to connect the mind to the body and to believe in
                the power within oneself.</p>
                <p>
                Her classes will focus on alignment, balance, confidence and learning how to own your
                breath and your body. She believes the connection to the pose is more important then the
                perfection of the pose. It truly motivates her to see her students gain confidence in
                themselves.</p>
                <p>
                She received her 200 hour yoga teaching certification from Yoga Mountain, New City, NY in
                2011.</p>
                <p>
                She received her 500 hour yoga certification from the Karma Vault, Nanuet, NY in 2014.
                </p>
                <p>
                Own your breath. Own your body.</br>
                Yoga is for any body.

                <p>
                  Audrey loves and is dedicated to the practice of yoga. She enjoys being present for the process and taking all the lessons she learns on her mat and bringing them off her mat and out into the world. Inspiration is found in the world around her, the seasons, all living creatures, rock and roll music, poetry,dance, hugs, smiles, human connection, gratitude and deep down love. She truly believes the sweetness and magic of this practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Audrey has been trained in Vinyasa Flow, Restorative, Prenatal, Trauma and Mommy and Baby Yoga. Her teachers include Lauren Magarelli, Mary Dana Abbott, Jamie Lyn Skolnick, Carrie Parker and Kelly Kamm.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When teaching she focuses on mindfulness and feeling. Setting up poses to go deeper into the body, the mind and the breath. Working to create a balance between movement and stillness. Deeply rooted in gratitude.
